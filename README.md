# Phase 1 Project Description


## Project Overview

The movie industry, a significant and profitable global sector, has captivated audiences for over a century. 
Key players include genre, actors, and producers. 
Microsoft, a technology firm, offers operating systems, cloud services, developer tools, and cybersecurity solutions.


### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)


### Business Understanding

Microsoft plans to launch a new movie company, despite lacking experience in film production. 
The research aims to identify the best box office genres, identify trends in movie popularity, and determine if higher production budgets correlate with higher revenue. 
Key attributes include the release month, highest-rated movies, and production budgets. The goal is to guide the company's film production.


### Objectives
1.Are there specific months or seasons when movies tend to perform better?
2.Are there any noticeable trends in movie popularity?
3.Is higher production budget correlated with higher revenue?


## DATA ANALYSIS

The year with the most movie releases is 2015, and the month with the most releases is January.
It implies that 2015 experienced a lot of new movie releases, with January being especially active.


### Recommendation and Conclusions

In 2015, January saw the highest number of movie releases, possibly indicating a specific trend in the movie industry during that time.
High budget movies are most popular due to high production quality, marketing, and promotions, with a positive correlation between budget size and audience popularity.
